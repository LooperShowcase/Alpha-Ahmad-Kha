      Fortnite: Save the World is a player-versus-environment cooperative game,
      with four players collaborating towards a common objective on various
      missions while avoiding the effects of an encroaching cataclysmic storm.
      The players take the role of commanders of home base shelters, collecting
      resources, saving survivors, and defending equipment that helps to either
      collect data on the storm or to push back the storm. From missions,
      players are awarded a number of in-game items, which include hero
      characters, weapon and trap schematics, and survivors, all of which can be
      leveled up through gained experience to improve their attributes. Fortnite
      Battle Royale is a player-versus-player game for up to 100 players,
      allowing one to play alone, in a duo, or in a squad (usually consisting of
      three or four players). Weaponless players airdrop from a "Battle Bus"
      that crosses the game's map, and then scavenge for weapons, items, and
      resources while trying to stay alive and to attack and eliminate other
      players. Over the course of a round, the safe area of the map shrinks down
      in size due to an incoming toxic storm; players outside that threshold
      take damage and can be eliminated if they fail to quickly evacuate. This
      forces remaining players into tighter spaces and encourages player
      encounters until the last player or team is alive. Lego Fortnite is a
      survival sandbox game, where players play as Lego Minifig versions of
      characters, as they collect materials, build various buildings, craft
      various weapons and tools and fight against monsters. Rocket Racing is a
      racing game, developed by Psyonix and serving as a spin-off title to
      Rocket League. Players race vehicles, gaining speed boosts from special
      lanes sections or by drifting, as well as the ability to jump and racing
      on vertical and inverted surfaces, while avoiding obsticles on the course.
      Fortnite Festival is a rhythm game developed by Harmonix, consisting of
      two modes. In the "Main Stage", players play popular rock songs, hitting
      notes to the rhythm in the Main Stage on one of the four unique parts:
      Lead, Guitar/Bass, Drums and Vocals, in a manner similar to Harmonix's
      Rock Band games.[4] In the "Jam Stage", players cooperate to make remixes,
      similar to Harmonix' Dropmix and Fuser, using any part of any song within
      Festival mode. In addition to these mode, Fortnite offers the sandbox
      mode, Fortnite Creative. Within this mode, players are given complete
      freedom to spawn any item from the Battle Royale gamemode on a personal
      island, and can create games such as battle arenas, race courses,
      platforming challenges, and more. Furthermore, it also supports Unreal
      Editor for Fortnite (UEFN), which allows players to edit worlds using
      Fortnite assets. All modes except Save the World are free-to-play; Save
      the World is pay-to-play.[5] The games are monetized through the use of
      V-Bucks, in-game currency that can be purchased with real-world funds, but
      also earned through completing missions and other achievements in Save the
      World.[6] In other modes, V-Bucks can be used to buy cosmetic items such
      as character models or the game's battle pass, a tiered progression of
      customization rewards for gaining experience and completing certain
      objectives during the course of a Battle Royale season.[7][8] All modes of
      Fortnite are cross-platform play compatible, requiring users to use an
      Epic Games account for cross-saving between platforms.[9] Fortnite: Save
      the World (2011–2017) Main article: Fortnite: Save the World § Development
      Fortnite began from an internal game jam at Epic Games following the
      publishing of Gears of War 3 around 2011. Though it was not initially one
      of the developed titles during the jam, the concept of merging the
      construction game genre, representing games like Minecraft and Terraria,
      and shooter games arose, leading to the foundation of Fortnite.[10][11]
      Development of Fortnite slowed due to several issues, including switching
      from the Unreal Engine 3 to Unreal Engine 4, a deeper role-playing game
      approach to extend the life of the game, and a switch of art style from a
      dark theme to a more cartoonish style. Further, Epic was looking to get
      into the games as a service model, and brought in Chinese publisher
      Tencent to help; Tencent took a large stake in Epic as part of this,
      leading to the departure of several executives, including Cliff
      Bleszinski, who had been a key part of Fortnite's development. Fortnite's
      approach was changed to be Epic's testbed for games as a service, and
      further slowed the development.[12][11][13] Epic was able to prepare to
      release Fortnite as a paid early access title in July 2017, with plans to
      release it as free-to-play sometime in 2019 while gaining feedback from
      players to improve the game.[14][15][16][17] With the release of Fortnite
      Battle Royale, the player-versus-environment mode was distinguished as
      "Save the World". Ultimately, Epic opted to release Save the World as a
      premium title, bringing it out of early access on June 29, 2020.[18]
      Fortnite Battle Royale (2017–2018) Main article: Fortnite Battle Royale §
      Development Near the same time that Epic released Fortnite into early
      access, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds had become a worldwide phenomenon,
      having sold over 5 million copies three months from its March 2017
      release, and drawing strong interest in the battle royale genre. Epic
      recognized that with the Fortnite base game, they could also do a battle
      royale mode, and rapidly developed their own version atop Fortnite in
      about two months.[19] By September 2017, Epic was ready to release this as
      a second mode from "Save the World" in the paid-for earlier access, but
      then later decided to release it as a free game, Fortnite Battle Royale,
      supported with microtransactions. This version quickly gained players,
      with over 10 million players during its first two weeks of release, and
      leading Epic to create separate teams to continue the Fortnite Battle
      Royale development apart from the Save the World version, outside of
      common engine elements and art assets.[20][21] This allowed Fortnite
      Battle Royale to expand to other platforms otherwise not supported by Save
      the World, including iOS and Android mobile devices and the Nintendo
      Switch.[22][23] Fortnite Creative (2018–2023) Main article: Fortnite
      Creative § Development A creative sandbox mode launched on December 6,
      2018, synchronized with the start of season 7 of Fortnite Battle Royale.
      Each player has access to a private, persistent island on which they
      construct buildings and add and manipulate objects as desired. Players are
      able to invite friends to this island and participate in unofficial games
      such as race tracks or jumping courses.[24] Only players who purchased the
      battle pass initially received their own island, but a week later, on
      December 13, players who did not purchase it received access to the game
      mode for free.[25] On March 16, 2023, Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN)
      was released, which allowed players to use the Unreal Editor with Fortnite
      assets. Fortnite Experiences (2023–present) In October 2023, Epic
      redesigned the main Fortnite client to present Epic's own various modes as
      well as the numerous creative modes as part of Fortnite Experiences,
      comparable to Roblox in presentation.[26] This was followed by the
      introduction of three new Epic-developed modes for the game in December
      2023: Lego Fortnite, a survival game developed in conjunction with The
      Lego Group, Rocket Racing, an arcade-style driving game developed by
      Psyonix, and Fortnite Festival, a rhythm game developed by Harmonix. Each
      mode was introduced as free-to-play, interfacing with the game's battle
      pass system, and offering new rewards associated with those modes.[27]
      Reception See also: Fortnite: Save the World § Reception, Fortnite Battle
      Royale § Reception and legacy, and Fortnite Creative § Reception The
      Fortnite Pro-Am event at E3 2018 The Save the World mode achieved over one
      million players by August 2017, just prior to the release of Battle
      Royale.[28] Fortnite Battle Royale became a significant financial success
      for Epic Games, leading them to separate the teams between Save the World
      and Battle Royale to provide better support for both modes. Within two
      weeks of release, over 10 million players had played the mode,[29] and by
      June 2018, just after the Nintendo Switch release, had reached 125 million
      players.[30] Revenue from Fortnite Battle Royale during the first half of
      2018 had been estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars per
      month,[31][32] with total 2018 revenue estimated at $2.4 billion by
      analysis firm SuperData Research.[33] Total revenue for Fortnite reached
      more than $9 billion by the end of 2019.[34] Fortnite Battle Royale has
      also become a cultural phenomenon,[35] with several celebrities reporting
      they play the game, and athletes using Fortnite emotes as victory
      celebrations.[36] A notable streaming event in March 2018, with streamer
      Ninja playing Fortnite Battle Royale alongside Drake, Travis Scott, Kim
      DotCom, and Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, broke
      viewership records for Twitch to date, and led to Epic arranging a
      Fortnite Battle Royale pro–am with 50 pairs of streamers and professional
      players matched with celebrities at E3 2018 in June 2018.[37][38][39] Epic
      Games has developed organized esports competitions around Fortnite Battle
      Royale, such as the inaugural US$30 million Fortnite World Cup tournament
      that took place in July 2019[40][41] and the Fortnite Championship Series
      (FNCS), the latter of which would be organized by Epic Games in 2020 and
      2021 before being organized by Blast ApS from 2022 onwards. See also:
      Fortnite Battle Royale § Parental concerns There has also been growing
      concern over Fortnite Battle Royale's draw toward young children,
      emphasized with the release of the mobile client. Parents and teachers had
      expressed concern that students are being distracted and drawn away from
      school work due to playing Fortnite.[42] Concerns have also been raised
      about the impact that playing a game involving repeated depictions of gun
      violence may have on young children.[43][44] Awards In 2017, the game was
      nominated for "Best Co-op Game" by PC Gamer,[45] and for "Best Spectator
      Game" by IGN.[46] In 2018, the game won the award for Best Ongoing Game by
      PC Gamer[47] and IGN,[48] the latter of which nominated it for "Best
      Nintendo Switch Game", "Best Mobile Game", and "Best Action
      Game".[49][50][51]
